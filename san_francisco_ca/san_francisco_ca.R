# Steps taken: 1. standardize variable names to match agreed upon
# format, generate empty vars for unavailable vars 2. Clean up date
# vars, amount awarded and do some sanity checks 3. Filter to cases
# we care about

# calendar_year/fiscal_year -> calendar year, pulled from payment
# date city\t-> generated incident_date\t-> don't have, generate
# empty var date_filed\t-> filed date closed_date\t -> payment date
# amount_awarded -> complete payment\t other_expenses\t-> don't have
# generate NA var collection\t\t-> don't have generate NA var
# total_incurred\t\t-> don't have generate NA var case_outcome\t\t->
# don't have generate NA var docket_number\t\t-> 'Court' var
# claim_number\t\t-> don't have generate NA var court\t\t-> don't
# have generate NA var plaintiff_name\t\t-> don't have generate NA
# var matter_name\t-> 'File Name' plaintiff_attorney\t\t-> don't have
# generate NA var location\t\t-> don't have generate NA var
# summary_allegations (separated by ;) \t-> 'alleged cause'

# Step 1 generate NA vars for incident_date, other_expenses,
# collection, total_incurred, case_outcome, claim_number, court,
# plaintiff_name, plaintiff_attorney, location rename Court -> docket
# number rename summary_allegations -> alleged cause rename
# matter_name -> file name generate city var
